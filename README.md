## Interview Challenge

This project was a React Development Challenge for a job interview

### Main Goal

Develop a simplified React version of the battleship game; player vs CPU.

### GAME ELEMENTS AND CHARACTERISTICS

- 10x10 board size
- 1 carrier of 4 spaces
- 3 cruisers of 3 spaces
- 1 submarine of 2 spaces
- Ships must be straight lines
- Ships can be placed horizontally or vertically

### BASIC GAMEPLAY

The game should have at least 3 screens with the following components and actions.
All mockups are just for reference and can be improved.

## START SCREEN

- Place your ships on the board
- Enter player name
- Button with “Start game” label

## GAME SCREEN

- Player and CPU boards
- Game state (”Playing: Player name or CPU”)
- Clicking on computer board, you launch your missiles
- Launched missiles reference
HIT –orange–, DESTROYED –red–, MISSED/WATER –light blue–
- Attempt feedback (ship hit, ship destroyed, shot missed)
- CPU missiles can’t be launched in random way (once the CPU hits a ship, the next
shots must follow some strategy in order to sink the ship)
- Surrender button to end the game manually
